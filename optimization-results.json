      "rationale": "Increasing the lookback period for indicators such as RSI or moving averages can provide a smoother and more stable signal, reducing the likelihood of reacting to short-term price noise.",

      "suggestedValue": 75,
      "rationale": "Adjusting the RSI upper threshold to a higher value may allow the asset more room before being considered overbought, possibly avoiding premature exits in strong uptrends.",
      "expectedImpact": "Less frequent but more targeted exits in overbought conditions might slightly increase average trade duration and profitability."

      "expectedImpact": "This change is expected to reduce false entry signals in fluctuating or weakly trending markets, potentially improving overall trade profitability."
