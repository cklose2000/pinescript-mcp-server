The error fixer has comprehensive tests and integrates properly with the MCP server.

## Repository Management

The project has been prepared for GitHub hosting with:

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive data and build artifacts
- Example environment file (`.env.example`) for documentation purposes
- Protection of API keys and sensitive credentials

Additionally, the repository structure has been improved:
- Test files moved from root and src directories to tests/manual/
- Documentation files organized in a dedicated docs/ directory
- All file references and imports updated to maintain functionality

## Phase 2 Planning

We've completed planning for Phase 2 of the project, which focuses on implementing LLM-driven optimization workflows. This includes:

### LLM-Driven Optimization Framework

A comprehensive plan has been created for:

This plan leverages our existing PineScript validation, fixing, and formatting capabilities while adding new LLM integration to automate the creative aspects of strategy optimization.

### New Directory Structure

Phase 2 will introduce several new directories:
- `src/llm` - LLM service integration
- `src/core/strategy` - Strategy parsing and analysis
- `src/automation/analysis` - Strategy analysis components
- `src/automation/backtesting` - Backtest result handling
