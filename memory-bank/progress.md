## Completed Phases
### Phase 1 - Core Functionality
- [x] Set up project structure with TypeScript and appropriate dependencies
- [x] Implemented configuration system with environment variable support
- [x] Created LLM service with API key management
- [x] Added support for OpenAI provider

### Phase 2 - Core Functionality Extension

## Error Fixer Implementation

The PineScript error fixer is now fully implemented and tested. Key capabilities include:

- Automatic detection of common syntax errors
- Fixing missing version annotations
- Handling unbalanced parentheses, brackets, and braces
- Closing unclosed string literals
- Adding missing commas in function arguments
- Updating deprecated functions like `study()` to `indicator()`
- Fixing incorrect variable export syntax
- Converting deprecated functions to newer namespace versions (e.g., `sma()` to `ta.sma()`)

The error fixer has comprehensive tests and integrates properly with the MCP server.

## Repository Management

The project has been prepared for GitHub hosting with:

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive data and build artifacts
- Example environment file (`.env.example`) for documentation purposes
- Protection of API keys and sensitive credentials

Additionally, the repository structure has been improved:
- Test files moved from root and src directories to tests/manual/
- Documentation files organized in a dedicated docs/ directory
- All file references and imports updated to maintain functionality
