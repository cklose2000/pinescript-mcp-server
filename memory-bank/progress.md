## Error Fixer Implementation

The PineScript error fixer is now fully implemented and tested. Key capabilities include:

- Automatic detection of common syntax errors
- Fixing missing version annotations
- Handling unbalanced parentheses, brackets, and braces
- Closing unclosed string literals
- Adding missing commas in function arguments
- Updating deprecated functions like `study()` to `indicator()`
- Fixing incorrect variable export syntax
- Converting deprecated functions to newer namespace versions (e.g., `sma()` to `ta.sma()`)

The error fixer has comprehensive tests and integrates properly with the MCP server.

## Repository Management

The project has been prepared for GitHub hosting with:

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive data and build artifacts
- Example environment file (`.env.example`) for documentation purposes
- Protection of API keys and sensitive credentials

## In Progress

- Integration of PineScript formatter with custom rules
- Indicator generation tool development
- Strategy generation assistant planning
- GitHub workflow configuration

## Next Steps

1. Implement the indicator generation tool
2. Develop the strategy generation assistant
3. Build alert management system
4. Create publishing tools for TradingView
5. Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration/deployment

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript type errors in test files that need fixing
- Complex error fixing scenarios may need additional pattern detection
- One test failing in errorFixer.tool.test.ts

## Latest Achievements

- Completed error fixer implementation with automatic detection and fixing
- Fixed comprehensive test suite to validate error fixing functionality
- Enhanced version management system for upgrading PineScript code
- Prepared project for GitHub hosting with proper security measures
