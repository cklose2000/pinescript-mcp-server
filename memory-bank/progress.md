# Project Progress

## Status Overview
The project is in Phase 3 of development, with a revised focus on user interface development, followed by enhanced prompt engineering and comprehensive testing. We've successfully implemented the template system with database integration, CLI management interface, and improved the LLM service to use templates with proper context management. All tests are now passing successfully, and we're pivoting to prioritize UI development to enable earlier user testing and feedback.
