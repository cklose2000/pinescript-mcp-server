# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing Phase 3 of the PineScript MCP project, starting with the Enhanced Prompt Engineering tasks. We are creating a more flexible and modular prompt template system to improve the quality and consistency of interactions with LLMs.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented a comprehensive template structure system for managing prompt templates
2. Created dedicated templates for strategy analysis, backtest analysis, and strategy enhancement
3. Updated the LLM service to use the new template system with backward compatibility
4. Added testing capabilities for template generation
5. Updated the directory structure to include a dedicated prompts module

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing the Enhanced Prompt Engineering phase:
   - Add specialized templates for optimization, educational content, and other use cases
   - Implement version control for templates
   - Create template evaluation metrics
   - Add a template development workflow

2. Begin planning the Comprehensive Testing Framework:
   - Define test scenarios and expected outcomes
   - Set up test infrastructure
   - Develop automated test scripts

## Active Decisions
1. **Template Structure Design**: We've decided to use a standardized template structure with defined sections (introduction, task, context, examples, constraints, output format) to ensure consistency across different prompt types.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: To ensure a smooth transition, the updated LLM service maintains backward compatibility with the existing configuration-based templates while introducing the new template management system.

3. **ESM Module System**: We're using ES modules throughout the project, which requires attention to file extensions (.js) in import statements.

## Technical Constraints
1. The project uses TypeScript with ES modules, requiring careful attention to import/export patterns.
2. We need to maintain compatibility with both OpenAI and Anthropic providers.
3. The system should allow for graceful fallback to mock providers for testing and when API connectivity issues occur.

## Current Issues
1. Need to ensure consistent output formats across different LLM providers
2. Testing with TypeScript ES modules requires specific configuration and run commands

### Recently Completed

- Added LLM configuration in the user config system
- Created a service architecture for interacting with language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Implemented a mock provider for development and testing
- Built CLI commands for strategy analysis and enhancement
- Created prompt templates for different types of strategy analysis
- Implemented the OpenAI provider with graceful fallback to mock provider
- Added commands for strategy enhancement and backtest analysis
- Created sample test data for backtest analysis
- Fixed OpenAI API key handling to properly extract multi-line keys from .env file
- Improved JSON response handling with better error tolerance and normalization
- Added more robust output formatting to handle undefined or missing properties
- Implemented the Anthropic provider with Claude API integration
- Created model-specific configuration for Claude models (opus, sonnet, haiku)
- Added a test command for Anthropic provider validation

### Active Work

We have completed the implementation of the LLM integration with the following components:

1. **User Configuration for LLM**
   - Added new configuration section for LLM providers and settings
   - Created helper functions to update LLM-specific settings
   - Provided default configuration values for development
   - Added CLI command to update OpenAI and Anthropic API keys and provider settings
   - Implemented model-specific configurations for different Claude models

2. **LLM Service Architecture**
   - Created a service that selects the appropriate provider based on configuration
   - Designed interfaces for strategy analysis and enhancement
   - Implemented a mock provider for testing without API credentials
   - Added graceful fallback mechanism when API authentication fails

3. **OpenAI Provider Implementation**
   - Created OpenAI provider that connects to the OpenAI API
   - Implemented proper error handling for API failures
   - Added JSON parsing for structured responses
   - Designed a custom method to extract API keys reliably from .env file
   - Added comprehensive debugging and logging for troubleshooting
   - Implemented JSON structure normalization for consistent response handling

4. **Anthropic Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented Anthropic provider using the Claude API
   - Added support for different Claude models (opus, sonnet, haiku)
   - Configured model-specific parameters (max tokens, temperature)
   - Created a test command to validate the Anthropic integration
   - Implemented robust error handling and JSON response parsing

5. **CLI Command Interface**
   - Built `llm analyze` command to examine strategies
   - Built `llm enhance` command to generate improved versions
   - Built `llm config` command to manage LLM settings
   - Added `llm analyze-backtest` command for backtest result analysis
   - Enhanced error handling in all commands to gracefully handle incomplete API responses
   - Added `test-anthropic` command for direct testing of the Anthropic provider

### Current Decisions

- Using a factory pattern to select the appropriate LLM provider
- Utilizing a mock implementation that returns realistic but static data when API authentication fails
- Successfully implemented both OpenAI and Anthropic providers
- Designing a system that can be extended to other providers in the future
- Successfully resolving OpenAI API key handling for multi-line .env file entries
- Supporting model-specific configurations for different LLM models

### Key Milestones
- End of Week 3: Review prompt engineering improvements
- End of Week 7: Evaluate testing framework effectiveness
- End of Week 10: Demo dashboard with basic visualization
- End of Week 13: Complete project review with all deliverables
