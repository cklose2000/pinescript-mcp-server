# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing Phase 3 of the PineScript MCP project, with an immediate pivot to prioritize the User Interface development. Based on user feedback, we're moving interface design and testing to the beginning of our timeline to enable earlier hands-on interactions, which will help identify limitations and push the boundaries of the system sooner.

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented a comprehensive template structure system for managing prompt templates
2. Created dedicated templates for strategy analysis, backtest analysis, and strategy enhancement
3. Updated the LLM service to use the new template system with backward compatibility
4. Added testing capabilities for template generation
5. Updated the directory structure to include a dedicated prompts module
6. Fixed issues in the template system tests to ensure proper validation and rendering
7. Resolved references to the correct template embedding method in vector store tests
8. Successfully ran the test suite with all tests passing
9. Reprioritized project plan to start with UI development instead of completing all template and testing work first

## Next Steps
1. Begin User Interface Design and Testing (New top priority):
   - Create design mockups for key workflows (strategy analysis, template management, search)
   - Implement a minimal viable UI for template management and strategy analysis
   - Set up quick user testing infrastructure to gather feedback
   - Rapidly iterate based on user interactions

2. Continue with Template Engineering (In parallel):
   - Add specialized templates for optimization, educational content, and other use cases
   - Implement vector search improvements for semantic template discovery
   - Add a template development workflow

3. Test Framework Development (Will follow user testing insights):
   - Define test scenarios based on actual user interaction patterns
   - Set up test infrastructure informed by UI usage patterns
   - Develop automated test scripts for high-priority workflows

## Active Decisions
1. **User-First Approach**: We've decided to prioritize UI development and user testing early in the process to identify limitations and requirements from hands-on interactions.

2. **Template Structure Design**: We've decided to use a standardized template structure with defined sections (introduction, task, context, examples, constraints, output format) to ensure consistency across different prompt types.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: To ensure a smooth transition, the updated LLM service maintains backward compatibility with the existing configuration-based templates while introducing the new template management system.

4. **ESM Module System**: We're using ES modules throughout the project, which requires attention to file extensions (.js) in import statements.

5. **Database Consolidation**: We've decided to focus on Supabase for both regular database storage and vector search capabilities, rather than using both Supabase and NeonDB. This will simplify the architecture and reduce potential integration issues.

## Technical Constraints
1. The project uses TypeScript with ES modules, requiring careful attention to import/export patterns.
2. We need to maintain compatibility with both OpenAI and Anthropic providers.
3. The system should allow for graceful fallback to mock providers for testing and when API connectivity issues occur.
4. Testing with TypeScript ES modules requires specific configuration and run commands, with some experimental loader warnings that need to be addressed.
5. The UI development must accommodate both local development and potential cloud deployment.

## Current Issues
1. The system is not currently easy for a human user to test without a proper UI.
2. Some tests are marked as pending when Supabase is not configured, which is expected behavior but requires documentation.
3. Need to ensure consistent output formats across different LLM providers.

### Active Work

We have completed the implementation of the LLM integration with the following components:

1. **User Configuration for LLM**
   - Added new configuration section for LLM providers and settings
   - Created helper functions to update LLM-specific settings
   - Provided default configuration values for development
   - Added CLI command to update OpenAI and Anthropic API keys and provider settings
   - Implemented model-specific configurations for different Claude models

2. **LLM Service Architecture**
   - Created a service that selects the appropriate provider based on configuration
   - Designed interfaces for strategy analysis and enhancement
   - Implemented a mock provider for testing without API credentials
   - Added graceful fallback mechanism when API authentication fails
   - Enhanced with template-based prompt generation

3. **OpenAI Provider Implementation**
   - Created OpenAI provider that connects to the OpenAI API
   - Implemented proper error handling for API failures
   - Added JSON parsing for structured responses
   - Designed a custom method to extract API keys reliably from .env file
   - Added comprehensive debugging and logging for troubleshooting
   - Implemented JSON structure normalization for consistent response handling

4. **Anthropic Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented Anthropic provider using the Claude API
   - Added support for different Claude models (opus, sonnet, haiku)
   - Configured model-specific parameters (max tokens, temperature)
   - Created a test command to validate the Anthropic integration
   - Implemented robust error handling and JSON response parsing

5. **Template System Implementation**
   - Created a standardized template structure with validation
   - Implemented a template manager for loading and retrieving templates
   - Added support for template rendering with placeholder replacement
   - Created a repository for template storage in Supabase
   - Added a vector store for semantic search capabilities
   - Implemented CLI commands for template management
   - Added testing for template validation, rendering, and vector search

6. **User Interface Development** (New focus)
   - Planning design mockups for key user workflows
   - Preparing rapid prototyping approach for quick user feedback
   - Researching appropriate UI frameworks for the project needs

### Current Decisions

- Prioritizing UI development early to enable user testing and feedback
- Using a factory pattern to select the appropriate LLM provider
- Utilizing a mock implementation that returns realistic but static data when API authentication fails
- Successfully implemented both OpenAI and Anthropic providers
- Designing a system that can be extended to other providers in the future
- Successfully resolving OpenAI API key handling for multi-line .env file entries
- Supporting model-specific configurations for different LLM models
