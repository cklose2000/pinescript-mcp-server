# Current Development Context

## Active Focus

We are working on a PineScript support toolset that integrates with Cursor via FastMCP. The project has now completed several key components including:

- A configuration system for user preferences
- Version management for PineScript code (converting between v5 and v6)
- PineScript error detection and fixing capabilities
- Formatting capabilities for consistent PineScript code style
- GitHub repository setup and secure environment management

Our most recent work focused on implementing a robust error fixer that can detect and automatically fix common syntax errors in PineScript code, including:

- Missing version annotations
- Unbalanced parentheses, brackets, and braces
- Unclosed string literals
- Missing commas in function arguments
- Deprecated function usage
- Incorrect variable export syntax

## Current Tasks

We've successfully completed the error fixer implementation with comprehensive tests and prepared the project for GitHub hosting. Our current areas of focus are:

1. **Indicator Generator Tool**: Create a tool that can generate PineScript indicators based on user specifications. This will involve:
   - Designing a parameter schema for different indicator types
   - Creating templates for common indicators (moving averages, oscillators, etc.)
   - Building a generator function that can customize these templates
   - Adding proper MCP integration for this functionality

2. **GitHub Integration & CI/CD**: Establish a proper development workflow with:
   - Complete GitHub repository setup
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Documentation generation

## Implementation Approach

For the indicator generator, we'll need to:

1. Create a system to define indicator parameters (periods, sources, colors, etc.)
2. Build template structures that can be populated with these parameters
3. Implement validation to ensure proper generation
4. Integrate with the MCP server as a new tool
5. Write comprehensive tests

For GitHub integration, we'll focus on:

1. Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Setting up branch protection rules
3. Creating issue and pull request templates
4. Establishing a contribution workflow

## Technical Considerations

- We should leverage our existing version management system to ensure generated indicators use the right PineScript version
- The generator should produce well-formatted code using our formatting utilities
- We'll need to carefully handle string templates to avoid syntax errors
- Documentation should be included in generated indicators
- Sensitive information must remain protected via environment variables and .gitignore

## Recent Decisions

- We decided to implement a comprehensive error detection system in a separate utility (errorDetector.ts) to support the error fixer
- All test implementations now use proper mocking techniques for isolated testing
- We've standardized the approach for integrating new tools with the MCP server
- We've established a secure approach to handling environment variables and API keys

## What's Working

- The configuration system is fully functional
- PineScript version detection and conversion works reliably
- Error fixing handles most common syntax issues
- The MCP server correctly registers and exposes all tools
- Repository management is set up with security best practices

## Next Steps

1. Start designing the indicator generator parameter schema
2. Create template structures for common indicator types
3. Implement the generator function
4. Add MCP server integration for this new tool
5. Write tests for the indicator generator
6. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
7. Complete initial release documentation
