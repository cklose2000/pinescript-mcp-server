# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently implementing the **LLM integration** for strategy analysis and optimization. The primary goal is to leverage AI capabilities to enhance PineScript trading strategies through automated analysis and improvement suggestions.

### Recently Completed

- Added LLM configuration in the user config system
- Created a service architecture for interacting with language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Implemented a mock provider for development and testing
- Built CLI commands for strategy analysis and enhancement
- Created prompt templates for different types of strategy analysis

### Active Work

We have completed the initial implementation of the LLM integration with the following components:

1. **User Configuration for LLM**
   - Added new configuration section for LLM providers and settings
   - Created helper functions to update LLM-specific settings
   - Provided default configuration values for development

2. **LLM Service Architecture**
   - Created a service that selects the appropriate provider based on configuration
   - Designed interfaces for strategy analysis and enhancement
   - Implemented a mock provider for testing without API credentials

3. **CLI Command Interface**
   - Built `llm analyze` command to examine strategies
   - Built `llm enhance` command to generate improved versions
   - Built `llm config` command to manage LLM settings

### Current Decisions

- Using a factory pattern to select the appropriate LLM provider
- Starting with a mock implementation that returns realistic but static data
- Planning to implement OpenAI provider next, followed by Anthropic
- Designing a system that can be extended to other providers in the future

### Next Steps

1. Implement the real OpenAI provider with proper API authentication
2. Add retry logic and error handling for API failures
3. Implement Anthropic provider with appropriate model selection
4. Fine-tune prompt templates for best results
5. Create more detailed strategy analysis output formats

## Technical Context

- LLM service is in `src/services/llmService.ts`
- CLI commands are in `src/cli/commands/llm.ts`
- Configuration updates are in `src/config/userConfig.ts`
- Example strategies for testing are in `examples/`
