## Current Focus

We are currently implementing the **LLM integration** for strategy analysis and optimization. The primary goal is to leverage AI capabilities to enhance PineScript trading strategies through automated analysis and improvement suggestions.

### Recently Completed

- Added LLM configuration in the user config system
- Created a service architecture for interacting with language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Implemented a mock provider for development and testing
- Built CLI commands for strategy analysis and enhancement
- Created prompt templates for different types of strategy analysis
- Implemented the OpenAI provider with graceful fallback to mock provider
- Added commands for strategy enhancement and backtest analysis
- Created sample test data for backtest analysis
- Fixed OpenAI API key handling to properly extract multi-line keys from .env file
- Improved JSON response handling with better error tolerance and normalization
- Added more robust output formatting to handle undefined or missing properties
- Implemented the Anthropic provider with Claude API integration
- Created model-specific configuration for Claude models (opus, sonnet, haiku)
- Added a test command for Anthropic provider validation

### Active Work

We have completed the implementation of the LLM integration with the following components:

1. **User Configuration for LLM**
   - Added new configuration section for LLM providers and settings
   - Created helper functions to update LLM-specific settings
   - Provided default configuration values for development
   - Added CLI command to update OpenAI and Anthropic API keys and provider settings
   - Implemented model-specific configurations for different Claude models

2. **LLM Service Architecture**
   - Created a service that selects the appropriate provider based on configuration
   - Designed interfaces for strategy analysis and enhancement
   - Implemented a mock provider for testing without API credentials
   - Added graceful fallback mechanism when API authentication fails

3. **OpenAI Provider Implementation**
   - Created OpenAI provider that connects to the OpenAI API
   - Implemented proper error handling for API failures
   - Added JSON parsing for structured responses
   - Designed a custom method to extract API keys reliably from .env file
   - Added comprehensive debugging and logging for troubleshooting
   - Implemented JSON structure normalization for consistent response handling

4. **Anthropic Provider Implementation**
   - Implemented Anthropic provider using the Claude API
   - Added support for different Claude models (opus, sonnet, haiku)
   - Configured model-specific parameters (max tokens, temperature)
   - Created a test command to validate the Anthropic integration
   - Implemented robust error handling and JSON response parsing

5. **CLI Command Interface**
   - Built `llm analyze` command to examine strategies
   - Built `llm enhance` command to generate improved versions
   - Built `llm config` command to manage LLM settings
   - Added `llm analyze-backtest` command for backtest result analysis
   - Enhanced error handling in all commands to gracefully handle incomplete API responses
   - Added `test-anthropic` command for direct testing of the Anthropic provider

### Current Decisions

- Using a factory pattern to select the appropriate LLM provider
- Utilizing a mock implementation that returns realistic but static data when API authentication fails
- Successfully implemented both OpenAI and Anthropic providers
- Designing a system that can be extended to other providers in the future
- Successfully resolving OpenAI API key handling for multi-line .env file entries
- Supporting model-specific configurations for different LLM models

### Next Steps

1. Create more sophisticated prompt templates with specific examples for better API responses
2. Add unit and integration tests for the LLM provider implementations
3. Build a web interface to visualize strategy analysis and backtest results
4. Implement a caching mechanism for API responses to reduce costs and improve performance
5. Add support for user-defined templates and custom analysis instructions
6. Add comparison functionality to evaluate responses from different LLM providers
