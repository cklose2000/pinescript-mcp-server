## Current Status
As of Week 2, we have completed most of the planned template system and database integration work:

1. **Template System Achievements**
   - Implemented a standardized template structure with section validation
   - Created a template manager for filesystem and database template management
   - Developed core templates for strategy analysis, backtest analysis, and enhancement
   - Updated the LLM service to use templates with fallback to legacy templates
   - Added support for dynamic prompt assembly with context variables

2. **Database Integration Achievements**
   - Implemented Supabase client for template storage
   - Created template versioning system with history tracking
   - Added template usage analytics collection
   - Implemented template repository with CRUD operations

3. **CLI Management Achievements**
   - Added 'templates test' command for system testing
   - Added 'templates list' command to browse available templates
   - Added 'templates sync' command to upload templates to the database
   - Added 'templates get' command to retrieve a specific template
   - Added 'templates versions' command to check version history

## Next Steps (Week 3)
The focus for Week 3 will be:

1. **Advanced Template Development**
   - Creating specialized templates for parameter tuning and market regimes
